# Unique Word Analyzer for Books
This Python script analyzes two books and determines which author used more unique words in their text. In this case, we compare "Crime and Punishment" by Fyodor Dostoevsky and "Moby Dick" by Herman Melville.

## Project Overview
This script reads the text from both books, processes the words by removing punctuation and converting them to lowercase, and then counts the number of unique words in each book.

## Result from Analysis:
'Crime and Punishment' has 10,571 unique words.  
'Moby Dick' has 19,958 unique words.  
Herman Melville used more unique words in 'Moby Dick'.  

## File Structure
Ensure your project folder contains the following files:

UniqueWordAnalyzer  
  ├── compare_books.py  (Python script)  
  ├── crime.txt         (Crime and Punishment text file)  
  ├── moby.txt          (Moby Dick text file)  
  ├── README.md         (This file)  

## Notes & Customization
You can replace crime.txt and moby.txt with any other books to compare their unique words.
